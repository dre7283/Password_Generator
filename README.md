# Password_Generator
Boot Camp Password Generator
Task
This is the third homework assignment for the OSU Coding bootcamp. We are creating a Random Password Generator

Installation
git clone: git@github.com:dre7283/Password_Generator.git
url to live page: https://dre7283.github.io/Password_Generator/
Review page to make sure html and javascript execute correctly.


User Story
We were provided starter code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  In this assignment we had to create a rand password generator based on the starter code provided.  The assignment is successfully complete when the user clicked the generate password button and:

            The user was asked a series of questions:
                How long should the password be?
                Should it contain special characters?
                Should it contain numbers?
                Should it contain upper and/or lower case letters?

The user will have to accept at least one of the criteria questions.  Once all questions have been answered a random password will be generated.
